Wizeline Academy was founded in 2017, with the mission of providing access to technical education to people, regardless of their age, gender, nationality, or location. We strongly believe that tech education has the power to change anyone’s future. In 2020, COVID-19 dramatically altered our society, and the need to develop skills for a digital future is even more apparent now. The pandemic has created irreversible changes to the ways organizations, enterprises, and governments operate.

According to the National Women’s Law Center, more than 2 in 5 of the 12.1 million women’s jobs lost between February and April have not yet returned. And while some of these jobs may return over time, some jobs may not return for a variety of reasons. The Institute for the Future estimates that 85 percent of the jobs that will exist in 2030 have not even been invented yet. 

There is a significant need for high-quality education to enable communities to be part of a robust economic recovery. To respond to this crisis, companies shifted the way they develop the necessary skills within the workplace. At Wizeline Academy, we have been grateful to be part of reshaping education that keeps the world learning. A record number of people turned to tech education. Since March 2020, there were more than 12,000 enrollments at Wizeline Academy — a roughly 105% increase compared to the same period the year before.

Wizeline Academy has become Wizeline’s continuous learning program in which all of our training efforts are consolidated and formalized. In March 2020, we had to reinvent the way we reached our students, changing all of our courses to virtual space in just a week. During the pandemic, we saw an increase of 30% in the non-technical audience who looked to change their career paths to the technical field. Some of our most popular courses were User Experience Design, Cloud Technologies, Data Engineering, and Front-end Engineering, specifically React.
